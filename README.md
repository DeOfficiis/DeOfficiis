Hello World,

I am interested in ETL, and the automation thereof, with a purpose to developing methods, to using the data in realtime.

The tools I am concentrating on are Python, SQL, Git, Azure, and AI/ML.

I am new(ish) to datascience, and the purpose of this github is to document the process of discovery.  

We'll see where the road will take me, and I am open to everything.
