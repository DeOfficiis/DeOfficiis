Hello World,

I am interested in ETL, and the automation thereof, with a purpose to developing methods to using the data in realtime.

My main field of interest are the money markets and the financial industry in general, but that's not restrictive; the world is a big and wonderful place, and there are many things that interest me.  

The tools I am concentrating on are Python, SQL, MQL4, Git, Azure, and AI/ML.

I am new(ish) to datascience, and the purpose of maintaining a presence on github is to document process of discovery.  

We'll see where the road will take me.
