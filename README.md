Hello World,

This github is called de_officiis, after the book of the ancient Roman philosoper and statesman Marcus Tullius Cicero, in which the principles for proper statesmenship are set out.  In a roundabout way, it is exactly what Github is. 

I am particularly interested in ETL, and the automation thereof, with a purpose to developing methods, to using the data in realtime.

The tools I am concentrating on are Python, SQL, Git, Azure, and AI/ML.

I am new(ish) to datascience, and the purpose of this github is to document the process of discovery.  

We'll see where the road will take me, and I am open to everything.
